# bgsu-3D-processing
Repository to store scripts for structure processing from BGSU RNA 3D motif atlas.


### 1. Downloading the data from RNA 3D motif atlas
Open `http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/`. Then go to `RNA 3D Motif Atlas > Home > Internal Loops > Download > json`. The version that I used was [3.78](http://rna.bgsu.edu/rna3dhub/motifs/release/il/3.78)

### 2. Download the structures from RNA Solo

### 3. Run RNAComposer to generate the structures

#### Create a *.dot file and add GC pairs to stabilize the structure

#### Add GNRA loop to solve the problem of two strands.
